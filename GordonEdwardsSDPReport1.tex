\section{Summary}
Building on Motiejus's code, the basis of the line tracking functionality, I tried to improve the steadiness and smoothness of its movement, and to prevent over-turns and wall collisions. I helped set up Bluetooth and integrated online code to send messages to the device at runtime, to simulate the robot's responses to the vision system. I also helped with builds of the robot.
\section{High Points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Adding code to stop the robot after a full circuit and to decide on its direction of travel based on its angle of boundary intersection
	\item Helping organise meet-up times and contributing ideas
\end{itemize}
\section{Areas to improve}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Need to write more code and acquire a deeper understanding of how each of the components work, particularly vision and communications, and how they can each be integrated
\end{itemize}
\section{Recommendations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I suggest that I receive a 3.5 or a 4. 
	\item I recommend that Mark is awarded a 5 because he has put a lot of time and effort into team coordination, initial code and re-factoring, repository set-up and robot design, 
	\item I also suggest Paul receives a 4 because he has added a lot of code for the vision system and it seems to be working quite well.
\end{itemize}
